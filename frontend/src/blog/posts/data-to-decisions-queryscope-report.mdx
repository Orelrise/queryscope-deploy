Your SEO is attracting new audiences. <strong>Action:</strong> Dig deeper into *which* terms are driving success (Step 2) and look for optimization/expansion opportunities.</li><li><strong>Low Non-Brand %:</strong> A flag indicating over-reliance on brand recognition. <strong>Action:</strong> Invest more in content targeting <strong>non-brand keywords</strong>, improve technical SEO, and build topical authority. The rest of the report is critical for identifying focus areas.</li></ul><p>Track this percentage over time. Is the <strong>non-brand share</strong> growing or shrinking?

Analyze <strong>top non-brand queries</strong>. For queries with good impressions but low CTR, rewrite titles/descriptions. Make them benefit-driven, include keywords naturally, add a CTA/USP.
